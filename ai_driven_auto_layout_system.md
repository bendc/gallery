# Specifications: AI-Driven Auto-Layout System

This document outlines the specifications for the AI-Driven Auto-Layout System for the futuristic gallery app. This system is responsible for dynamically adjusting the gallery's layout and presentation based on device context, inferred user attention, and simulated environmental factors. It works closely with the "Adaptive Layout Module," "Dynamic UI Rendering Engine," and "3D Gallery World Engine."

## 1. Adaptation to Phone Orientation & Tilt

The system will intelligently adapt the gallery's presentation beyond typical responsive design, considering the device's physical orientation and tilt to optimize usability and immersion.

*   **Portrait vs. Landscape Modes:**
    *   **Portrait Mode:**
        *   **Gallery World Perspective:** Emphasizes vertical depth and layering. Content might appear to flow "upwards" or "downwards" more prominently in the 3D space.
        *   **Tile Arrangement Density:** May favor vertically elongated tiles or arrangements that encourage vertical scrolling. Density might be slightly higher to leverage vertical screen real estate.
        *   **UI Elements:** Navigation controls might be anchored more firmly to the bottom or top edges for easy thumb access.
    *   **Landscape Mode:**
        *   **Gallery World Perspective:** Adopts a wider, more panoramic or cinematic view of the 3D space. Horizontal parallax and depth cues become more pronounced.
        *   **Tile Arrangement Density:** May favor horizontally elongated tiles or wider grid layouts. Could offer a more "spread out" feel, allowing individual pieces more breathing room.
        *   **UI Elements:** Controls might shift to the sides or offer alternative interaction methods suitable for a two-handed grip.

*   **Influence of Device Tilt:**
    *   **Held Upright (standard viewing angle):**
        *   UI controls (like menus, filters, trail activators) could be fully visible or subtly highlighted, assuming active engagement.
        *   The 3D "Gallery World" maintains its standard perspective.
    *   **Tilted Back (e.g., user leaning back, phone angled upwards):**
        *   The system might infer a more passive viewing state.
        *   The "Gallery World" could subtly expand its field of view, creating a more expansive, "lean back" experience.
        *   Primary UI controls might slightly retract or become more translucent, minimizing distraction, while secondary contextual elements (like image information) could become more prominent if an item is in focus.
        *   Parallax effects might become more sensitive to smaller tilt changes to maintain engagement.
    *   **Flat on a Table (or near flat):**
        *   The layout might shift to a "showcase" mode, perhaps cycling through featured content with larger visuals if no direct interaction is detected.
        *   UI controls might become larger and more clearly delineated, anticipating less precise interaction.
        *   The 3D perspective might flatten slightly, offering a clearer overview of a layer of content.

*   **Conceptual Example:**
    "A user is viewing the gallery in portrait mode, holding the phone upright. Images are arranged in a dynamic, vertically scrolling list with noticeable depth via parallax. When they rotate the phone to landscape, the 'gallery world' view expands horizontally, revealing more images to the sides, and the current focal image becomes part of a wider, more cinematic spread. Later, the user is lying down, phone tilted significantly upwards. The main navigation buttons subtly fade their opacity by 20% and shrink slightly, while the generative art backdrop becomes more prominent. If they tap on an image, its metadata panel, usually at the bottom, might appear slightly larger and with increased contrast for easier reading from an reclined angle."

## 2. Simulated Gaze Tracking Impact

Given the challenges of actual gaze tracking, this system will use *simulated* gaze tracking, inferring the user's likely focal point through indirect indicators to adapt the UI subtly.

*   **How Simulated Gaze Tracking Works (Conceptual):**
    *   **Touch Proximity & History:** The system tracks where the user taps or initiates gestures. Consistent interaction in a specific screen region suggests that area is within their general field of attention.
    *   **Image Focus Duration:** The amount of time an image remains largely unobscured and centered (or near-centered) on the screen after a scroll stops can imply focus.
    *   **Accelerometer/Gyroscope Data:** Subtle device movements or the angle at which the device is held can provide clues. For example, if the phone is consistently tilted slightly to the left, it might infer the user's gaze is more frequently directed towards the left side of the screen.
    *   **Scroll Behavior:** The point at which a user consistently stops scrolling, or areas they repeatedly scroll back to, can indicate regions of interest.
    *   **Predictive Analysis:** Based on the current focal point and viewing history, the AI can predict likely next points of interest.

*   **How Simulated Gaze Affects the UI:**
    *   **Subtle Highlighting/Emphasis:** The presumed focal point (e.g., an image or a cluster of images) might receive a very subtle increase in brightness, saturation, or sharpness, or its morphing UI elements might become slightly more active. This should be almost imperceptible consciously but should guide the eye.
    *   **Peripheral Content Introduction:** Related content (e.g., images from the same "Emotional Trail," similar aesthetic, or same event) might be gently introduced or made slightly more prominent in the peripheral areas of the presumed gaze.
    *   **Detail Level Adjustment (Conceptual):** Images directly in the simulated gaze path could be prioritized for loading higher resolution versions, while those in the far periphery might initially load as lower-resolution placeholders.
    *   **Dynamic Layout Shifting:** If sustained simulated gaze is detected in one area, the layout might subtly "drift" or expand in that direction, bringing more content into that field of view or re-centering the perceived focal point.

*   **Conceptual Example:**
    "The user is viewing a grid of images. They tap on an image in the upper-left quadrant, then another nearby. The system simulates their gaze as being focused on this quadrant. Subsequently, as they scroll, new images appearing in this upper-left area might load slightly faster, and the generative art backdrop might exhibit slightly more complex animations in this region. If they then hover (simulated by a pause in scrolling with an image centered) on an image for several seconds, that image might subtly 'pulse' in brightness, and related tags or a button to start an 'Emotional Trail' might appear with greater opacity near it."

## 3. Simulated Soundscape Mood Detection Influence

This feature aims to adapt the gallery experience based on the perceived mood of the user's auditory environment. Given privacy and technical complexities, this will likely be a *simulated* detection or based on broad contextual clues rather than precise real-time microphone analysis.

*   **Conceptual Determination of "Soundscape Mood":**
    *   **Direct Analysis (Permission-Dependent & Technically Advanced):** If the user grants microphone permission, the system *could* perform on-device analysis of ambient sound characteristics:
        *   **Volume Levels:** High (busy street, cafe) vs. Low (quiet room, library).
        *   **Rhythmicity/Chaos:** Rhythmic sounds (music, steady hum) vs. chaotic noise (traffic, crowd chatter).
        *   **Frequency Analysis:** Predominance of harsh, high frequencies vs. softer, lower frequencies.
    *   **Simulated/Contextual Inference (More Likely):**
        *   **Accelerometer/Motion Data:** High levels of device motion (walking, commuting) might imply a noisier, more distracting environment. Low motion (device stationary) could imply a quieter setting.
        *   **Time of Day:** Late night or early morning might correlate with quieter environments.
        *   **Location Type (If available and permitted):** Known locations like "home" vs. "office" or "transit stop" could provide clues.
        *   **Calendar Events (If permitted):** An event like "Concert" vs. "Meditation session."
        *   **User Profile/Preferences:** User might explicitly set preferences for different environments.

*   **Influence on Gallery Layout or Ambiance:**
    *   **Loud/Busy/Chaotic Soundscape (or high motion):**
        *   **Layout:** Simplifies. May shift to a single-image focus mode, larger image tiles, increased spacing between elements, and larger touch targets. Reduces visual clutter.
        *   **Ambiance:** Generative art backdrops might become less distracting, perhaps more static or with very slow, subtle changes. Fluid Morphing UI responses might be toned down to avoid overstimulation.
        *   **Content Curation:** May prioritize quickly digestible content or offer to pause "Emotional Trails."
    *   **Quiet/Calm/Rhythmic Soundscape (or low motion):**
        *   **Layout:** Allows for more complexity. Denser grids, smaller tiles (allowing more on screen), and more intricate arrangements become viable.
        *   **Ambiance:** Generative art backdrops can be more dynamic and detailed. Fluid Morphing UI can be more expressive. "Emotional Trails" and discovery features are encouraged.
        *   **Content Curation:** May suggest more contemplative or detailed content.

*   **Conceptual Example:**
    "The app, through accelerometer data, detects the user is likely on a bumpy commute (simulating a 'chaotic' soundscape). The gallery layout automatically shifts from a 3xN grid to a single-column, full-width image view. UI controls become slightly larger, and the generative backdrop fades to a near-solid, calming color. Later, when the device is stationary for a prolonged period in the evening (simulating a 'quiet' mood), the gallery reverts to a denser grid layout, reactive morphing effects on tiles become more pronounced, and the AI curator might suggest starting a new 'Emotional Trail'."
